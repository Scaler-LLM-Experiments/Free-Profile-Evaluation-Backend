## 1. PROFILE STRENGTH NOTES

### Output:
```
"You're building your skills in the right direction. Here's what to prioritize:
Your 3-5 years at TCS show you're past the learning curve and ready to level up.
For someone with 3-5 years of experience, learning system design fundamentals
should be your next major focus – it's what separates senior engineers from
mid-level ones. You've solved 11-50 problems – a decent start, but to crack
competitive roles, aim for 100+ with focus on medium-hard problems. Having 1-5
repos is good, but polish them with READMEs, tests, and live deployments to
make them interview-ready. Build fundamentals systematically – realistic
timeline is 6-9 months to reach interview readiness."

## AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT

### 1. **Peer Comparison Clarity** (Frontend)
**Issue**: "65% percentile" - doesn't explain what "peer" means.

**Solution**: Add frontend component explaining peer group:
```
👥 Peer group: Tech professionals with 3-5 years experience
   targeting product-based companies
```

### 2. **CTAs for Expert Guidance** (Frontend)
**Issue**: No clear call-to-action for users who want expert help.

**Solution**: Add subtle CTAs after major sections:
```
Need help creating a personalized prep plan?
[Talk to Career Expert] →
```

### 3. **Floating Call Back Button** (Frontend)
**Issue**: No persistent way to request callback.

**Solution**: Add floating button at bottom center:
```
┌─────────────────────┐
│  📞 Request Call Back  │
└─────────────────────┘
```
