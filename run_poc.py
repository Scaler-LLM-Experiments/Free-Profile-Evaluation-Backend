        "   - Select 3-5 most relevant quick wins based on the user's specific profile\n"
        "   - Prioritize based on: current role ‚Üí experience ‚Üí target role ‚Üí skills\n"
        "   - Combine related suggestions when appropriate\n"
        "   - Ensure actionable items that can be completed in 1-4 weeks\n"
        "   - Use the exact wording provided above, but adapt if multiple conditions apply\n\n"
        "CRITICAL RULES FOR opportunities_you_qualify_for:\n"
        "- List 5-7 realistic job opportunities with SPECIFIC company names from Indian market\n"
        "- Match experience level: Junior roles for 0-2 years, Mid/Senior for 3-5, Senior/Staff for 5+\n"
        "- Include mix of: Product companies, Unicorns, Well-funded startups, Service-based (if experience < 2 years)\n"
        "- Format: '[ROLE] at [SPECIFIC COMPANY] - [KEY REQUIREMENT]'\n"
        "  Examples:\n"
        "  - 'Senior Backend Engineer at Razorpay - Strong in distributed systems and payment processing'\n"
        "  - 'Staff Engineer at CRED - 5+ years with microservices architecture experience'\n"
        "  - 'SDE-2 at Flipkart - 3-5 years with e-commerce domain knowledge'\n"
        "  - 'Tech Lead at PhonePe - Proven track record in scaling fintech applications'\n\n"
        "VALIDATION CHECKLIST (Internal - Review Before Finalizing):\n"
        "‚òë Does EVERY recommended role match experience level?\n"
        "‚òë Does systemDesign='multiple' lead to senior/staff roles?\n"
        "‚òë Are ALL roles HANDS-ON TECHNICAL/ENGINEERING roles (no PM/UX/BA/QA Manual)?\n"
        "‚òë Are recommended_tools SPECIFIC and NOT basic platforms (no GitHub/GitLab/Turbo C)?\n"
        "‚òë Are quick_wins DETAILED with action ‚Üí outcome ‚Üí timeline?\n"
        "‚òë Are opportunities REALISTIC with REAL Indian company names?\n"

        "‚òë Zero non-technical roles in the entire response?\n\n"
